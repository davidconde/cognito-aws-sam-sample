# AWS Sam and Cognito Demo

This project is a quick way to get a serverless API providing user authentication using Cognito. 

For a quick introduction into what is AWS Sam, [please go here](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).
For a quick introduction into what is AWS Cognito, [please go here](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).

I will be building on top of this and adding more as I progress into more functionalities. For a full walkthrough of how I've been doing this, you can [follow me on Medium](https://medium.com/@david.conde.marin) or simple start with the first post on the [Creating a Serverless authentication API](https://medium.com/dcms-blog/creating-a-serverless-authentication-api-part-1-86f65a6e9efc)

## Installation 

To run the project there's a few required tools:

### Install the AWS Cli
First tool that needs installing is the AWS CLI. You can use the [Install link for MacOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-macOS.html). Once the Cli has been installed, you'll need to configure your cli. To do so, open the AWS console with your user:

 - Go to IAM
 - Once in the IAM console, find your user and go to Security Credentials
 - If you have an existing access key, you should have both the access key and a secret
 - If you don't have one, create it on the console

Once you have a key and a secret to connect the CLI with your account go to a command prompt and use

```
aws configure
```

Once you've run this command, follow the instructions.

### Install Docker

To be able to run the Api for local testing you will need to install docker in your Mac. To do so, you'll need to [download it from here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

### Install the AWS SAM Cli

Our API runs as a serverless project, which means you'll need the AWS SAM Cli for running the project. You can [follow the official guide for installing it on MacOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-mac.html)

## Notes

It's also worth having a read on the [docs generated by AWS sam on the creation of a project](/aws-sam-readme.md).
